zhsh
===========
This module is a port of the Java implementation of the Zhang-Shasha
algorithm for tree edit distance (found here:
https://github.com/ijkilchenko/ZhangShasha). It supports the simple
string based language for creating trees that the original supports and
allows the user to create their own trees for comparisson.
